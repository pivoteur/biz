# BTC+ETH pivot pool

2024-10-21: Good morning, all!

./dawn has recommendations for the BTC+ETH pivot pool and the PAXG pivot pool.

Let's take each pool and each recommendation in turn, starting with the BTC+ETH pivot pool. 

Okay, BTC+ETH. I've zoomed into the chart to take an instructive moment. ./dawn is recommending an ETH -> BTC swap, but, should we? Looking at the chart, we're really straining at gnats here, ...

... OR. ARE. WE???

The instructive points are two-fold.

First, ETH-high is a rarity, that's why ./dawn has a strong recommendation, even on this very slight up-tick.

Second, we can close a pivot at 10% ROI, so ./dawn's recommendation is a good one, after all.

As we've just closed a BTC on ETH pivot, we hand the gains over to the distributor, which distributes the gains to: investors, the echo pool, the treasury, and back to the BTC+ETH pool.

We do 5 transactions for the BTC-gain, but we hold off distributing from the treasury until after all close pivots come in.

Butbutbut wait! One of the distributions from the BTC-gain was to the BTC+ETH echo pool.

So, here is the BTC+ETH echo pool.

It's mostly UNDEAD tokens, which brings up the need for a DCAr. I'll talk about the DCAr after today's report.

So, let's now turn to ./dawn PAXG recommendations.

# PAXG pivot pool

## BTC -> BNB

./dawn BTC -> BNB recommendation

This is a no-go. The trade for an open pivot is below the minimum ($1k) for the protocol, and there are no 10%+ ROI close pivots.

But, let's look at something. Every $BNB trade on uniswap is worse than the same trade on @PancakeSwap on BSC, ... of course.

So, why do I bring up Binance/@PancakeSwap ? 

$LTC / Litecoin was mentioned as an area of interest, and $LINK / Chainlink has promise. Both tokens have liquidity on BSC that make trading there viable.

![LINK pairs](imgs/08b-link-pairs.png)

I've started tracking both these pivot charts. 

## BTC -> PAXG

For the BTC -> PAXG ./dawn recommendation: no. The open-side is < $1k and the close side is not 10%+ ROI.

![No close PAXG pivots](imgs/09b-no-close-paxg-pivot.png)

This completes the pivots, so, let's now distribute from the treasury.

# Treasury

The treasury received a portion of the $BTC-pivot-gain.

Because of that, the treasury distributes a portion of all gains to investors.

From incept, investors have received both $PAXG and $BTC yields for investing $UNDEAD into the pivot pools and the treasury.
