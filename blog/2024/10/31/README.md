2024-10-31: As opposed to doing recommendations and analyses, I'm focused on protocol infrastructure.

* I've established two wallets for operational expenses and investments
* I'm collating all my investments across the blockaverse with the aim of donating all of them to the protocol, in exchange for an investment-stake of $UNDEAD into the pivot pools created from those donations.

* Completed: wallets created on ledger and $UNDEAD moved.

* In progress: extracting my assets from the various blockchains and protocols to take stock of what I've got where.
