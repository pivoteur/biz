# `./otto`

2024-11-26: TUESDAY? of THANKSGIVING WEEK???

I swap 170k $UNDEAD to $ETH. Unfortunately, 'acceptable slippage' on Uniswap is now more than $100 on what should have been $800 worth of $ETH. Oh, well.

I do the swap, anyway, to BUIDL self-generating liquidity within the Pivot protocol.

# Open Echo Pivot

I see a good close echo pivot when I simulate it, so, before I close a pivot, I open a new echo pivot and record the transaction.

# Close Echo pivot

So, now I close the echo pivot for a 12k $UNDEAD gain. I'm growing my $UNDEAD in this pool, which is good, as that is the point of the Echo pool.

Next: to grow value of the $UNDEAD token, and that will start when I'm buying more $UNDEAD than what I'm selling, which means after the pivot pools are established.
