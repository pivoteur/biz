I closed another pivot this morning for a nearly 20% ROI. What's interesting here is that we started with 0.2 $ETH and 100k $UNDEAD in the Echo pool, and now, today, we have more of both.

That's the magic of pivoting. Over time, both your assets grow, slowly but surely, and by slowly, I mean 10%-20% ROI. ðŸ¤£
