# BTC

I just saw [this chart on twitterz](https://x.com/MarketPalmer_/status/1862300447362441342) ... let's climb our way to the top 1%, eh? The pivot protocol will help us to do that.

# `./otto`

`./otto` transfers the last 55k $UNDEAD liquidity to $ETH for the BTC+BNB pivot pool; ... four more pools to complete.

# Echo pivots

I simulate a close Echo pivot: looks good, so first I open a new Echo pivot, THEN close the pivot and record the results.

![Record pivot](imgs/02c-record.png)

The close pivot was 14% ROI / 1.7k% APR, btw. I'm quite pleased about that. I still must transfer liquidity and open pivots on the pivot pools. Once that becomes a well-oiled machine, I can start buying-back $UNDEAD in the Echo pool, which will put buy-pressure on $UNDEAD. This will take some time, but then we will chart growth from both pivots and $UNDEAD price re-gains.
