When we get LPs funded on multiple blockchains, the game released, and the Pivot protocol launched, what will $UNDEAD look like? 

You see that $UNDEAD's price is rising, but so is its rank (not going down the ranks, as it should). This shows a lot of competing crypto is entering or rising in the markets. $UNDEAD just has to beat them all now, is all. ðŸ˜Ž
