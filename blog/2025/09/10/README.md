When we get LPs funded on multiple blockchains, the game released, and the Pivot protocol launched, what will $UNDEAD look like?

# State of the Pivot Protocol, 2025-09-10

Good day, pivoteurs! 

News: Hey, folks. I have been quiet recently, but busy in the background. I have the [1/2-month personal finance I must address today](https://x.com/logicalgraphs/status/1965759041843741100).

I also have also Pivot protocol goals of: 

1. Pivot all pivot-pools 
2. Correct virtual swap representaitons 
3. begin coding/testing individual staker-portfolio page

![Pivot protocol NAV-vs-EMA20 chart](imgs/02c-ema.png) 

You will note the Protocol NAV today crossed above the EMA-20, meaning that, even self-regulated, the protocol makes gains, showing a good balance of assets pivoted and liquidity in reserve.
