Good morning, all!

## Work completed

Pool-indexing is now data-driven, meaning:

![Data-driven indexing](imgs/01a-pool-indexing.png)

* we get what we got before, now with accurate and up-to-date measures

![Adding new pools](imgs/01b-automated.png)

* right) we can now add pools ... 'automagically' by updating links and references in the data now.

## TODO

There's work to be done on and from this page:

1. The 'automagically' adding new pools requires manual intervention for the landing-page of each of these pools. These pages should be templated.

2. The non-pool stakes (treasury and echo pool) need to be automated.

With a 2-line addition to the pools.html javascript, I now how non-pool stakes (treasury and echo) automated and data-driven.

So 2. goes from TODO to TODOne!
