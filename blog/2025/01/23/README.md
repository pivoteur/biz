No good close pivots and we already have an open pivot at this δ-band.

No action.

## The non-explanation explanation

Going forward, I'm going to be silent on non-actions. So if I don't do something for a pivot-pool, open a pivot or close a pivot, I'm not going to say why anymore, ... I'll just assume you know that there's no good close pivot or the open pivot doesn't have a good δ-band, okay?

# No Action

Concluded review of all pivot pools. No actions today (no new open nor close pivots).

Some days it do be like that.

Remember: activity doesn't equate to growth. Sometimes doing nothing is the best course of action.
