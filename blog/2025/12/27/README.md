G'day, pivoteurs!

# PIVOTS

![`dusk` report: no close-pivots](imgs/01-dusk.png)

`dusk` reports no close-pivots today.

Automation for determining open-pivots is 
[underway](https://github.com/pivoteur/protocol/tree/main/dapps/dawn). 
I'll continue working on open-pivots automation today.

# Development

"I did some work today"[1](#note-1) and got `assets` running. 

![Very first `assets`-report](imgs/02-assets.png)

With `assets` I now have a 
snapshot of the protocol's pivot pools, partitioned by TVL.

## Notes

### Note 1

"I did some work today" eheh. Well: yeah. Duh. 🙄 It's not like it's Christmas, or anything.[2](#note-2)

### Note 2

It actually is the Octave of Christmas.
