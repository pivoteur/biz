# Pivots, 2025-12-12

Today's `hound`-report for close-pivots have some interesting juice to sweeze. Let's see what I can do today. 

## UNDEAD+USDC close pivot

30% gain on $4,500-trade, or, $900 profit on an $UNDEAD pivot.

Even though `hound` said it would be (much) more, but the horrendous slippage for $UNDEAD-trades turned at 50% gain to a 'mere' 30% gain.

I'll take it, and distribute the gains to investors in the UNDEAD+USDC pool.
