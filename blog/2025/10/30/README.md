Good day, pivoteurs! 

News: Thanks to the stake from a new investor, Î¹, the protocol saw a surge of NAV-growth. Not only that, but $UNDEAD, as well, has seen increased volume, perhaps indicating increased interest, with its first, organic, $100k 24-hour volume. 

## Pivot Protocol Snapshot 

![Protocol NAV](imgs/06a-nav.png) 
![Protocol value by asset](imgs/06b-by-asset.png) 
![Protocol dapp allocation](imgs/06c-by-dapp.png) 
![Protocol distributions](imgs/06d-dists.png) 

### Custody 

* 50M $UNDEAD = $133,750 

### Investments 

* 1.5 $BTC = $162,498 
* 4980999 $UNDEAD = $13,324 

total: $309,572 


### Pivot Protocol 

* NAV = $339,442 
* reinvestments/distributions = $18,967 

This shows the protocol has generated $48,836 in value. 

# PIVOTS!

Let's go to @hedera.

![Hedera](imgs/07-hedera.png)

I'm not supposed to say: "I'm not familiar with this blockchain," ...but we all start somewhere, ne? I'm not familiar with this blockchain, so: let's learn together.

I'm open to hearing if you know better ways to do things on @hedera than what I do.

## Hedera wallets

First off, @hedera isn't like an EVM, as it's a hashed-graph, not a block-chain, so you get a hash, not an address.

![HashPack wallet](imgs/08a-hashpack.png)

HashPack is standard wallet that Hedera apps accept.

![Linked EVM wallet](imgs/08b-evm.png)

You can link your EVM address and add Hedera to your EVM wallet, as well, but not all apps accept the latter.

## HBAR+USDC 

![Close HBAR-on-USDC hedge](imgs/09a-close-hbar-on-usdc-hedge.png) 

I close 1 HBAR-on-USDC hedge for gains of: 


* actual ROI: 13.76% / 132.21% APR projected 
* or: 1,135.40 $HBAR -> $USDC -> 1295 $HBAR 
* or: $29.66 gain on a hedge totalling $249.79 


![Distribute gains to stakers](imgs/09b-dist-gains.png) 

I reinvest the gains or distribute 80% to stakers. 

## Defillama info on Hedera

It is instructive to note that choosing the DEX changes the amount received from the swap significantly.

@DefiLlama shows (some) of the [apps on @hedera and their TVLs](https://defillama.com/chain/hedera).

![Defillama Hedera info](imgs/09c-defillama.png)
![Hedera apps and their TVLs](imgs/09d-hedera-apps.png]

It would stand to reason that those apps with larger liquidity render better swaps.


## Hedera DEXen

This reasoning bears out: 

1. @SaucerSwapLabs DEX, with the highest TVL, has the most efficacious HBAR -> USDC swap.

![Saucer Swap](imgs/09e-saucer.png)

2. @HSuiteNetwork DEX wasn't close.

![HSuite](imgs/09f-hsuite.png)

3. @HeliSwap_DEX I couldn't connect HashPack, but the swap resulted in 150 $HBAR less for the same amount of $USDC swapped.
