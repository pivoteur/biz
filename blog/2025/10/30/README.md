Good day, pivoteurs! 

News: Thanks to the stake from a new investor, Î¹, the protocol saw a surge of NAV-growth. Not only that, but $UNDEAD, as well, has seen increased volume, perhaps indicating increased interest, with its first, organic, $100k 24-hour volume. 

## Pivot Protocol Snapshot 

![Protocol NAV](imgs/06a-nav.png) 
![Protocol value by asset](imgs/06b-by-asset.png) 
![Protocol dapp allocation](imgs/06c-by-dapp.png) 
![Protocol distributions](imgs/06d-dists.png) 

### Custody 

* 50M $UNDEAD = $133,750 

### Investments 

* 1.5 $BTC = $162,498 
* 4980999 $UNDEAD = $13,324 

total: $309,572 


### Pivot Protocol 

* NAV = $339,442 
* reinvestments/distributions = $18,967 

This shows the protocol has generated $48,836 in value. 

# PIVOTS!

Let's go to @hedera.

![Hedera](imgs/07-hedera.png)

I'm not supposed to say: "I'm not familiar with this blockchain," ...but we all start somewhere, ne? I'm not familiar with this blockchain, so: let's learn together.

I'm open to hearing if you know better ways to do things on @hedera than what I do.

## Hedera wallets

First off, @hedera isn't like an EVM, as it's a hashed-graph, not a block-chain, so you get a hash, not an address.

![HashPack wallet](imgs/08a-hashpack.png)

HashPack is standard wallet that Hedera apps accept.

![Linked EVM wallet](imgs/08b-evm.png)

You can link your EVM address and add Hedera to your EVM wallet, as well, but not all apps accept the latter.
