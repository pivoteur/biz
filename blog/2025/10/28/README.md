# Transition to Hedera

Good morning, pivoteurs!

The Pivot Protocol is making a transition to the @hedera  blockchain/hashgraph.

The protocol has added a document on how to add Hedera to your EVM wallet (mm, particularly).

## Finding your Hedera Hash

Once you've added the Hedera network, how do you find your Hedera hash?

Simple!

1. While having 'Hedera' selected as your blockchain, select the 'hamburger'-menu-dropdown on your wallet
2. Select 'view on explorer.'

Your EVM address will be displayed as a Hedera hash.
