News: What is happening with $UNDEAD? Well, besides the fact we are up 100% – I will get into that token-analysis next – but how stands the Pivot Protocol? 

Very well, as a matter of fact. We are up 10x from where we were for half-a-year.

## Observing Distributions today

The interesting thing, for me, will be distributions. When the bear hits, hard, distributions go through the roof.

When we get LPs funded on multiple blockchains, what will $UNDEAD look like?
