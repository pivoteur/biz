News: What is happening with $UNDEAD? Well, besides the fact we are up 100% – I will get into that token-analysis next – but how stands the Pivot Protocol? 

Very well, as a matter of fact. We are up 10x from where we were for half-a-year.

## Observing Distributions today

The interesting thing, for me, will be distributions. When the bear hits, hard, distributions go through the roof.
