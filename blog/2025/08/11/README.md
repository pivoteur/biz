When we get LPs funded on multiple blockchains, what will $UNDEAD look like? 

## Comment

OH, NOES! $UNDEAD is down 50%! IS IT OVER? AM I FIRED?

Down 50% from what? If you can only have a token be up-only, then this may be too much for your constitution, even $BTC may be too much. "Down 50%" is not the whole story.

Find assets that work for you and stick to the Plan.

### Commentary

Commentary

So: $UNDEAD.

Down 50%? Or up 285%?

Both are correct. It's a matter of perspective. What is the company doing? What is the [token's value](https://logicalgraphs.blogspot.com/2022/03/value-dialog.html)? Does it fit in your portfolio, or not? These are the questions to ask.
