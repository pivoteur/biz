## Analysis / pensée

Among the sea of @ethereum knock-offs, Cardano stands out for its very different approach. Every transaction has a hostage-fee that is returned by a confirmation transaction.

That means everything is twice as expensive and twice as slow.

* Does Cardano's hostage-fee and confirmation discourage scammers? Yes.
* Are scammers problematic on Ethereum-based blockchains? Yes.
* Is the Cardano approach a good one? I'm ambivalent.

It is one of the largest blockchains with the volume to show for it. So: here's to weird!

# PIVOTS 

## AVAX+UNDEAD 

I close 1 pivot for gains of: 

### Open Pivots

![Positive δ](imgs/04b-delta.png) 

The positive δ calls to open an AVAX-on-UNDEAD pivot, which I do.

I also open an UNDEAD-on-AVAX hedge.

The AVAX+UNDEAD pivot pool composition and γ-apportionment are as charted.
