## Analysis / pensée

Among the sea of @ethereum knock-offs, Cardano stands out for its very different approach. Every transaction has a hostage-fee that is returned by a confirmation transaction.

That means everything is twice as expensive and twice as slow.

* Does Cardano's hostage-fee and confirmation discourage scammers? Yes.
* Are scammers problematic on Ethereum-based blockchains? Yes.
* Is the Cardano approach a good one? I'm ambivalent.

It is one of the largest blockchains with the volume to show for it. So: here's to weird!

When we get LPs funded on multiple blockchains, what will $UNDEAD look like?
