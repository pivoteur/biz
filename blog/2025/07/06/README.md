## Ethereum retrospective

Now, I don't know if I'm been bombarded by hopium-particles, but it seems to me that the revisions to the @ethereum blockchain has brought down transaction fees significantly, from, say $20, $100, $200/transaction to 25¢-$5/transaction.

Still way, WAY too high, but it's a start.

With @ethereum being the mother of most smart-contract-based and Proof of Stake-based blockchains, and being the original host for @wagyugames @UndeadBlocks game and ERC20 token, $UNDEAD, I look forward to continued improvements and cost-reductions on this blockchain.
