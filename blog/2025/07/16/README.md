# $UNDEAD Liquidity Pools

![Uniswap LP AVAX/UNDEAD on Avalanche](imgs/03-uniswap-lp.png)

@UndeadBlocks has an @Uniswap LP AVAX/UNDEAD on @avax. Stay tuned for ANNOUNCEMENTs for LPs we are launching today on DEXes on @avax.

For $UNDEAD, the fun begins: today.

You MAY want to start thinking about an investment into $UNDEAD. #NFA #DYOR 

# PIVOTS

## AVAX+UNDEAD

![Close UNDEAD-on-AVAX hedge](imgs/04-close-undead-hedge.png)

I close 1 hedge for gains of:

* actual ROI: 16.57% / 6046.50% APR projected
* or: 150k $UNDEAD -> $AVAX -> 175k $UNDEAD
* or: $63-gain on $265-hedge

Instead of distributing gains, I'm in conversations with stakers about using the gains to BUIDL new pools.

### Open AVAX+UNDEAD pivots, 2025-07-16 

![UNDEAD Ratio](imgs/05a-ratio.png) 
![Positive Î´](imgs/05b-delta.png) 

The positive Î´ calls to open an AVAX-on-UNDEAD pivot, which I do. 

![Open AVAX pivot](imgs/05c-open-avax-pivot.png) 

I also open an UNDEAD-on-AVAX hedge. 

![Open UNDEAD hedge](imgs/05d-open-undead-hedge.png) 

The AVAX+UNDEAD pivot pool composition and Î³-apportionment are as charted.

### Gains disposition

After discussing with stakers, we're going ahead with profit from +UNDEAD pivot pools funding new pivot pools.

![Swap 80% of gains to $BTC](imgs/07a-swap-to-btc.png)
![Distribute gains](imgs/07b-dist-gains.png)

I swap 80% of the gains to $BTC and send it to the treasury addy to reserve funds to start new pools.

I'll be creating these new pivot pools sequentially.

# Bridging $UNDEAD

![Bridge UNDEAD from Ethereum to Avalanche](imgs/08-bridge-undead.png)

In preparation for funding liquidity pools on @avax, I bridge $UNDEAD from my @Ledger addy on @ethereum using @VeraBridge_io. 

# PIVOTS (reprise)

## ETH+UNDEAD

D-mn. ðŸ˜³

![Close UNDEAD-on-ETH hedge](imgs/09a-close-undead-hedge.png)

I close 1 hedge for gains of:

* actual ROI: 32.97% / 12034.06% APR projected
* or: 135k $UNDEAD -> $ETH -> 181k $UNDEAD
* or: $113-gain on $259 hedge, ... WHAAAA?? ðŸ’¥

![Swap gains to $ETH](imgs/09b-swap-to-eth.png)

I swap 80% of the gains to $ETH in reserve to fund new pivot pools.
