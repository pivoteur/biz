## AVAX+UNDEAD

![Close UNDEAD-on-AVAX hedge](imgs/04-close-undead-hedge.png)

I close 1 hedge for gains of:

* actual ROI: 16.57% / 6046.50% APR projected
* or: 150k $UNDEAD -> $AVAX -> 175k $UNDEAD
* or: $63-gain on $265-hedge

Instead of distributing gains, I'm in conversations with stakers about using the gains to BUIDL new pools.
