# Establishing Pivot pools on Avalanche

It's 5 o'clock on a Saturday ... ðŸŽµðŸŽ¶ (of course, 5 am for me, Billy Joel had it easy: all he had to do is sweat in front of the mic playing the piano for decades before he made it big, ... huh. There's something in that 'hard work'-thing).

Let's get to establishing pivot pools.

## UNDEAD+USDC

I establish the UNDEAD+USDC pivot pool on @avax  with 1.2M $UNDEAD.

The Î´ is meh, so I pivot in both directions, ... timidly ($200-ish), ... my aim is to pivot at $1k liquidity.

The UNDEAD+USDC pivot pool composition and Î³-apportionment are as charted.
