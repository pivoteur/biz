# BTC and automation

Good morning, pivoteurs! 2025-11-21

$BTC is doing what $BTC is doing.

Meanwhile, for my backend-automation, one minor, necessary, tweak is to show what a 10% gain in the close pivot would be.

This is necessary to close a pivot from simulated to frfr.

## Future work for automation

Okay, now I have two directions for future work:

1. consolidate all pivot close recommendations to one trade per side. This'll be a bit of infrastructure-work.

2. Automagically interate over all pivot pools to make a daily recommendation en masse, collating all assets to pivot.

... but before this coder gets carried away doing his favorite thing (spoiler: coding), let's do the daily workflow.
