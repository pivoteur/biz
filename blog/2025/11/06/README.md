# A Continuation from Yesterday

Good morning, pivoteurs! 2025-11-06

I'm in a odd position, as I closed pivots for BTC-on-USDC last night, but have yet to open new pivots for the BTC+USDC.

A cold and 1:30 am caught up to me.

So, I record the pivot-closes in yesterday's entries, and open pivots today.
