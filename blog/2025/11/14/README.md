# UNDEAD market trend

Do you know what I find weird, @UndeadBlocks-iers?

![UNDEAD price chart](imgs/01-undead.png)

Everything in the Crypto-markets is crashing, but $UNDEAD is actually rising in the ranks.

It's not a lot, and it has a long way to go, but why are we going up when the markets are tanking? 

Me: I'll take it. 📈
