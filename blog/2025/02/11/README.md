Good morning, all! What amazing adventures lie in wait for us to discover TODAY?

They, themselves, must wait upon my breakfast and neighborhood walk, because #priorities. Since crypto is a medium of exchange, like money, it isn't everything: it's a means (medium).

# PIVOTS

BTC+BNB

I don't have a good close pivot today, but a wide swing to a negative Î´ calls for opening a BNB-on-BTC pivot, which I do.

I am now hedged, both ways, on the BTC+BNB pivot pool with pivots open in both directions.

## BNB+LTC

I close a BNB-on-LTC pivot for gains of:

* actual ROI: 14.03% / ðŸ’¥1707.01% APRðŸ’¥ projected
* or: 0.169 $BNB -> $LTC -> 0.191 $BNB WHAAA??

The Î´ is negative, calling for a LTC-on-BNB pivot, but all $LTC is already committed.
