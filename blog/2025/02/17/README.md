Hi, all

# Pivots

Anybody else seeing intolerably slow swap-routes on @binance @PancakeSwap? 

I'm trying to trade $BNB for either $LINK or $LTC but @PancakeSwap is not coming up with a swap-route after 7 minutes+ of searching.

Okay, @binance is back up and running; swaps are working again on @PancakeSwap.

No pivots today. GOOD NIGHT! ðŸ˜´
