# PIVOTS

BTC+BNB

WOOT! ðŸ’¥

![Close BTC-on-BNB pivot](imgs/02a-close-btc-on-bnb.png)

I close a BTC-on-BNB pivot for gains of:

* actual ROI: 13.02% / 52.21% APR projected
* or: 0.003 $BTC -> $BNB -> 0.0034
* or: $32-gain on $318-pivot

![Negative Î´](imgs/02b-neg.png)

The negative Î´ calls to open a BNB-on-BTC pivot, but all $BNB is committed.

# Pivot Arbitrage

I don't know how many times I have to repeat this so that everybody in the world gets this, so this is my job now:

ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥
PIVOT ARBITRAGE MATERALIZES $BTC FROM $BTC (pivoting on another asset) (or materalizes whatever you want to materialize by pivoting on another asset)!
ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥

Let's put this into context.

Let's say you have 100 $BTC. Yay! And good for you.

With pivot arbitrage, your ROI can be 10% or more on that $BTC (in the pivot above, it's actually 13%).

That's just ROI, not projected APR.

Are you getting that from your $BTC? Because you can.
