# PIVOTS 

## ETH+UNDEAD 

No close pivots. 

The positive δ calls to open an ETH-on-UNDEAD pivot, which I do.

The Echo pool composition and γ-apportionment are as charted.

## UNDEAD+USDC

Now, yesterday, I said I was going to open an UNDEAD+USDt pivot pool, however, @Uniswap had no trading path for that for a while.

![No USDt-to-UNDEAD swap on Uniswap](imgs/04-usdt.png)

That seems to have cleared up.

At any rate, I'm going with an UNDEAD+USDC pivot pool, as USDC seems to be more widely accepted.

So, I move some $ETH and some reserve $UNDEAD from the Echo pool to the new UNDEAD+USDC pivot pool.

![Transfer reserve UNDEAD](imgs/05b-xfer-undead.png)

This requires I reconfigure my Echo pool γ-factors and configure new γ-factors for the UNDEAD+USDC pool.

![Configure UNDEAD+USDC γ-factors](imgs/05d-configure.png)

Even though the new pool has all $UNDEAD, I'm pretending a 50/50 split.
