When we get LPs funded on multiple blockchains, what will $UNDEAD look like?

# PIVOTS

I am refocusing all efforts on $UNDEAD revitalization. I have set aside 5M $UNDEAD for when $UNDEAD is traded on other blockchains and moved all remaining $UNDEAD to the Echo pool, which is an ETH+UNDEAD pivot pool.

No close pivots today.

I open a new pivot and hedge.

n.b.: As I have both $ETH and $UNDEAD in hand, I can do a virtual UNDEAD/ETH swap, therefore not selling $UNDEAD. The ETH-on-UNDEAD hedge is an actual swap, however, so I do buy $UNDEAD.

After liquidity-infusion, the Echo pool's composition and γ-apportionment are as charted.

# CONCLUSION 

This concludes pivot-activity for today.
