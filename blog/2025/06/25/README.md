# Providing Liquidity

Okay, now we're going to work on getting liquidity on @avax, and tradeable liquidity, at that! How do we do that?

Via [VeraBridge](https://app.verabridge.io/).

![Vera Bridge](imgs/02-vera-bridge.png)

Let's bridge 100k $UNDEAD over to @avax to start building liquidity (and @Uniswap liquidity pools) there.

![Bridge Warning of no $AVAX on @avax](imgs/03-no-avax.png)

Opp! Vera Bridge says I ... 'need'/'should have' $AVAX on @avax before I bridge.

Okay. Fair. Other bridges don't freak about this, but I suppose if a protocol doesn't see $AVAX on an @avax address, it may feel better doin' the supafreak.

I'll get some $AVAX there first.

Transfer/transaction fee is still $2.86.

Stupid @ethereum.

I'm going to approach this a different way.

Ciao for now.

![$AVAX from Avalanche](imgs/05-personal-avax.png)

Okay, I did some pivoting on my own portfolio @logicalgraphs, and earned some $AVAX there, which I transferred to the Pivot protocol's treasury wallet here on @avax. 

The hoops I have to jump, ... around (?) ... because I'm dealing with @ethereum. 
## Bridged UNDEAD to Avalanche

Using verabridge, I get the $UNDEAD tokens over onto Avalanche.

![Bridged UNDEAD to Avalanche via VeraBridge](imgs/06a-undead-xferred.png)

I must manually enter the contract for my wallet to see these tokens.

![UNDEAD on Avalanche shows in wallet](imgs/06b-undead-on-avax.png)

* $UNDEAD on @avax contract: 0x5a3534720A4f29FA0dc53cE474Db88973A95f65C

We need to add that contract and Avalanche blockchain to @coingecko.

# PIVOTS 

## ETH+UNDEAD 

No close pivots. 

### Open Pivot 

![Positive δ](imgs/07a-pos.png) 

The positive δ calls to open an ETH-on-UNDEAD pivot, which I do. 

![Open ETH pivot](imgs/07b-open-eth-pivot.png) 

I also open an UNDEAD-on-ETH hedge. 

![Open UNDEAD hedge](imgs/07c-open-undead-hedge.png) 

The Echo pool composition and γ-apportionment are as charted.

## UNDEAD+USDC 

No close pivots. 

### Open Pivot 

![Negative δ](imgs/09a-neg.png) 

The negative δ calls to open an USDC-on-UNDEAD pivot, which I do, after I first transfer some $UNDEAD from the treasury. 

![Transfer UNDEAD to pool from treasury](imgs/09b-xfer-undead.png)
![Open USDC pivot](imgs/09c-open-usdc-pivot.png) 

I also hedge with an UNDEAD-on-USDC pivot. 

![Open UNDEAD hedge](imgs/09d-open-undead-hedge.png) 

The UNDEAD+USDC pivot pool composition and γ-apportionment are as charted.
