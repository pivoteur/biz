# Providing Liquidity

Okay, now we're going to work on getting liquidity on @avax, and tradeable liquidity, at that! How do we do that?

Via [VeraBridge](https://app.verabridge.io/).

![Vera Bridge](imgs/02-vera-bridge.png)

Let's bridge 100k $UNDEAD over to @avax to start building liquidity (and @Uniswap liquidity pools) there.

![Bridge Warning of no $AVAX on @avax](imgs/03-no-avax.png)

Opp! Vera Bridge says I ... 'need'/'should have' $AVAX on @avax before I bridge.

Okay. Fair. Other bridges don't freak about this, but I suppose if a protocol doesn't see $AVAX on an @avax address, it may feel better doin' the supafreak.

I'll get some $AVAX there first.

Transfer/transaction fee is still $2.86.

Stupid @ethereum.

I'm going to approach this a different way.

Ciao for now.
