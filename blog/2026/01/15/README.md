# UNDEAD

G'day, pivoteurs!

![$UNDEAD chart](imgs/01-undead.png)

On the @UndeadBlocks-side, $UNDEAD's price took a leap! ... basically doubling in price in one day. 

> Correction! Not 'double' in price, but a 10% gain, much less than my first look showed me, but still not an insignificant price-gain for $UNDEAD.

# PIVOTS

![`dusk` report](imgs/02-dusk.png)

`dusk` recommends two close-pivots. Let's take a look.

## BTC+USDC

![No close USDC-on-BTC pivot](imgs/03-no-close-usdc-pivot.png)

The USDC-on-BTC close doesn't make the cut. Oh, well. $BTC did take a dip after this morning. 

## Open BTC+USDC pivots

The positive δ calls to open an BTC-on-USDC pivot, which I do.

I also open an USDC-on-BTC hedge.
