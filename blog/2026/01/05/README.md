# UNDEAD

I don't know why the price of $UNDEAD took a leap. An investors mentioned he's buying up $UNDEAD in anticipation of the Pivot protocol launch, but the 24-hour volume doesn't speak to a huge buy.

At any rate, the price-jump of $UNDEAD today materialized $5k for the protocol. 💥💥

The pivot is good, so I execute it, using $HBARX from @staderlabs to close this pivot.

* actual ROI: 14.27% / 247.96% APR projected

I reinvested all gains.
