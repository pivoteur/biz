# PIVOTS

![`dusk` report](imgs/02-dusk.png)

Oddly enough, `dusk` reports no close pivots for today. I'm waiting on a response from @HashportNetwork on a fix from them so I can bridge assets to @hedera. 

I continue to BUIDL open-pivot automation, focusing on computing assets committed to virtual swaps.

# Automation update

Automation progress!

We present `virtsz`

![Virtual pivot assets](imgs/03-virtsz.png)

`virtsz` shows assets committed to virtual pivots, which is useful to me in the ongoing operations and maintenance of the pivot pools.

Next step: show assets availabe for open-pivot calls.
