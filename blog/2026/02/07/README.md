All assets are (still) secured. We suffered no loss of assets during the 
recent market-tumble.

Pivot Protocol, pre-release α, version 14, now has "Pivot Swap" on the DIY++ 
Chart-tab.

## Pivot Swap

Pivot Swap allows you to compute a 'reasonable swap' at today's market prices, 
so you can see how much you'd get for your own pivots. 

What is the aim of Pivot Swap? 

It's two-fold:

1. It gives the Pivot Protocol a degree of freedom from DEXen and blockchains, 
should the swaps be unfavorable due to slippage or other factors.

2. Stakers into the pivot pools earn trading-fees on swaps executed on Pivot 
Swap.
