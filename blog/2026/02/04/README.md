G'day, pivoteurs!

I was today's-years-old when I realized that Bitcoin Treasury Companies have 
the TLA of BTC. #themoreyouknow.

$BTC is down. Am I worried? No. I'm pivoting.

## "When should I pivot, al geophf?"

[TFlowers87](https://x.com/TFlowers_87/status/2019052420999815193) states on
the twitters:

> Pivot like our lives depend on it.

My response to that is:

Pivot 'til the Sun goes down.
Pivot 'til the cows come home.
Pivot 'til both, neither, and either. 

## `dusk` report

## Hedera woes

![Close pivot on Hedera at 18% slippage](imgs/04-slippage.png)

I try to close the ETH-on-BTC pivot on @hedera @SaucerSwapLabs, however, 
slippage is 18%, making any attempt to close the pivot an outright loss.

Still.

Must I set up my own DEX on @hedera? I think I must, in order to make pivoting 
there viable.
