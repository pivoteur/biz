## Agenda

* Discussed turning crypto into fiat currency. Showed a pivot arbitrage trade
that netted ~$84 gain, how I converted that to $USDC then moved 80% of that
liquidity to Coinbase. 20% remains in the pivot-pool, growing the pool.

* This serves two purposes

1. It pays down the self-loan
2. It proves out that crypto can be converted to liquidity that can be used
for operational expenses

... demonstrating a pragmatic application of cryptocurrency.
