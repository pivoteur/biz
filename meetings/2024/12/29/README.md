# Working Session, 2024-12-29

## Locations at K-market

* Suny Sushi
* YouLike BBQ

## Session Commenced: 11:30 am

* Thinking about breaking the BNB+LTC+LINK triple pool into two pools:
  * BNB+LTC and
  * LINK+DOT
* Will that entail a whole new set of wallets? That's the cleanest approach
* LINK+DOT I've been thinking about for a while, but how is the performance of
BNB+LTC ... BNB+LTC is doing okay. LTC+LINK is doing best, so that's a sad
good-bye.
* The advantage is that we have the BNB+LTC pool established already, and it's
easy enough to transfer the LINK to a new wallet.

## Session concluded: 12:45 pm
