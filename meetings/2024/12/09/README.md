* Estimated expenses needed at least a week before payment due
* CFO states we need $6,000 outgo on each of the 1st and 15th of each month
for living expenses
* Founder stated to make $1,000 in a pivot, $10k needed to be in play, meaning
that $100k needs to be in the pool. But, on reflection, if 30% can now be
committed to a pivot then the pivot pool can be as low as $30k.
