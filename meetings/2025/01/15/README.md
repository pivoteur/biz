# Working session, 2025-01-15

## Location: Home, Chicken Pollo order-in

* Completed an audit of the Pivot Protocol dapp, enumerated functionality that was broken, was working, and that could be improved
* From that audit, I implemented solution for the BTC+ETH, BTC+BNB, and BTC+DOGE UX to get up and running from an automated, data-driven solution.
* Next up, I'll need to create data-driven indices into the pivot pools and data-drive the BNB pivot pools
