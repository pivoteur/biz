## Meeting commenced, 5:00 pm

### Wagyu

* Wagyu discussed infrastructure change from AWS to Google cloud on a $200k grand from Google
* Wagyu discussed opening $UNDEAD to alternate blockchains, Apechain, Binance, Avalanche and looking forward to setting up LPs on these chains by the end of the month or mid-February
* Wagyu discussed OTC, MasterCard, Visa, and Bank purchases of UNDEAD
* Wagyu discussed several interested investors for Wagyu's games and for the pivot protocol

### Pivot Technologies

* Wagyu was impressed that Pivot Protocol broke even end-of-year, 2024
* I shared my sales and buys of 800k $UNDEAD, funding the six pivot pools in operation
* I shared the need for dev-expertise to convert the protocol from a website to a blockchain dapp
* I shared that the gains are small now, given the small sizes of the pivot pools. My aim to to be making $1k per pivot, and until I'm at that level of trading, I'll be focusing solely on pool-growth. Once we're at that level of trading, I'll start to build the treasury from the pivot arbitrage gains.

## Wagyu

* Wagyu suggested hosting a TGE / Token Generation Event to raise capital for protocol operating expenses and funding pivot pools. I said that's a great idea, and when Wagyu has a plan in place, let's discuss further.

## Meeting concluded, 5:45 pm
