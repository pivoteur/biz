# Working session, 2025-01-04

## Location, McDonalds

## Session commenced, 7:45 am

* Generated [2024 Year-end protocol report](../../../../reports/2024)
* The supporting data for the pools' gains is (much) more detailed, but I didn't see a succinct and simple way to represent pool-data, particularly in the context of comparing pools to each other, or representing a snapshot of all pools (as opposed to representing an individual pool, for which I use the radar-chart), ... perhaps that will be the subject of future work.

## Session concluded, 11:31 am
