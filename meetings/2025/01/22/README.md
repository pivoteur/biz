# Working Session, 2025-01-22

## Wendy's order in

* Simplified assets.tsv so that now only the TVLs are recorded.
* Researched object-iteration in Javascript. This took much longer than anticipated because simple iteration of a javascript object's attributes is irregular.
* Updated table.js and bar.js so that TVL bar-charts are now using updated assets.tsv
* pushed code and data updates to production
