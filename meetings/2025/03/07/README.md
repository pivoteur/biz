## Takeout, McDo

* Need to investigate how to bridge assets to and from Cardano. I'm thinking via $wADA on @binance.

## USA Crypto Reserve Announcement

President Trump announced that the following crypto would be part of the USA crypto reserve: $BTC, $ETH, $XRP, $SOL, and $ADA.

The Pivot protocol already pivots on $BTC and $ETH. I need to investigate how to incorporate $SOL and $ADA on their native chains (which also means bridging liquidity to and from those chains).

I'm not familiar with how to pivot on $XRP / Ripple, although there are some tutorials out there on $XRP arbitrage.

Your thoughts on $XRP. Worth pursuing?
