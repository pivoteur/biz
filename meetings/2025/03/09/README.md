* Starting tomorrow, I'm instituting a hedge into my pivot-strategy.

A hedge is the total opposite of a pivot, so, if the Î´ calls for a BTC-on-ETH pivot, say, I'll hedge the pool with an ETH-on-BTC pivot (given no existing ETH-on-BTC pivots). 

Now, at face value, the hedge is stupid! I'm buying high. So, I'll hedge at 50% of the standard pivot-amount, and I'll only have one hedge-per-pool in play.

With this hedge-tactic, I'm now playing with the EMA-20 trend and against the EMA-20 trend.

Let's see how this goes.
