## Take-out Suny-Sushi and Szechuan Star

* Working on consolidating wstETH assets. I moved this liquidity to Arbitrum. The problem, however, is that it's axl-wstETH and there appear to be no trade-routes at present on Arbitrum.
* It's stated that Shade protocol has a trade there, but I've lost too much on that zone to risk it.
* There does exist a trade-route on MantaSwap on Kujira, so I'll try that.
