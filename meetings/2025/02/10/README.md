# Working session, 2025-02-10

## Take out: Swiss Bakery

* Explored ways to automate site-navigation. This isn't an issue with Frames, but frames have their own set of problems that I don't like dealing with.
* So, I came up with a framework around mapping the `pathname` to the site-navigation and put it into a Javascript workflow.
* This workflow works with a prototype that is straight/plain HTML-based, that is: without frames, so I'll need to transition the entire site to this plain-style.
