## Agenda

* Solana
* So, I don't really understand $SOL and Solana, but a lot of other people do, as it's 6th in the world, so top-10 cryptocurrency. Top-10 doesn't mean anything, as Ripple ($XRP) is top-3, but top-10 is a lot more reassuring than below top-100.
* At any rate, Indigo protocol has $iSOL, however, slippage for that synthetic is 15%, so I'm considering trading BTC+SOL, ETH+SOL and SOL+USDC on Solana, that way: the native token stays native, and I don't need to worry about synthetic issues nor slippage.
* That's not to say that I won't pivot on iSOL+ADA, but I'll only do that with workable trading properties, and not before.
