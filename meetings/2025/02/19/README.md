## Exploring Cardano

* Cardano has synthetic assets ($iBTC, $iETH, $iSOL, $iUSD) from Indigo protocol that allows participation in liquidation of these assets via staking
* So, these synthetic assets can be pivoted against each other. I'm not too keen, however, as transaction fees are not insignificant, and these assets are synthetic, so they only derive value so long as the protocol maintains pegs for these synthetics
* However, participation in liquidations AND staking give rewards in both $ADA and $INDY (the Indigo protocol's token).
* Also, these assets can be traded against $ADA, allowing for pivot arbitrage with Cardano protocol's token, which is a top-10 asset on its own.
* I've set up wallets for myself and exploring pivot arbitrage, then, with the gains, I'll look to Indigo Protocol as the treasury for these synthetics and off-ramp staked-gains as converted-to-real assets via ... Coinbase (?) then hosted on their native chains (e.g.: moving $iBTC stake-gains to the Bitcoin blockchain)
