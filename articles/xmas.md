## Merry Christmas, Pivoteurs!

The Pivot Protocol has a Christmas gift For our $UNDEAD investors: $UNDEAD gains
from a close UNDEAD-on-BTC pivot! (tweet:

Besides pivot-gains, which, to be fair, is the raison d'être for the protocol,
we have much to look forward to in the coming year. Let's take a look as to
what's cooking.

## Protocol Launch

As the 2025 year closes, we are just going to squeak in with a Protocol-launch
on the Hedera HashGraph (blockchain). *whew!*

What does this mean for the Protocol and its investors?

1. _Standard protocol experience_. As an official protocol, you get all the 
standard protocol-features: staking, unstaking, reinvesting yields or 
harvesting yields. Like now, you get to see what your stake in each pivot pool 
is, but this will all now be automated on the Undead Blocks user interface.

2. _Mindshare_. The Pivot protocol, now being official and also part of the
Undead Block user-experience, will get more eyes onto pivot arbitrage and onto
the $UNDEAD token. Increased mindshare is not directly correlated to price-
appreciation of the $UNDEAD token, but we have see positive results with
increased attention on the token and protocol.

3. _Widespread Adoption_. Having the Pivot Protocol integrated with the Undead
Blocks-game introduces thousands of gamers to uses of the blockchain for more
than gaming. Certainly, many gamers will use their earned and purchased $UNDEAD
to buy new or improved game-assets. That, in itself, increases $UNDEAD-utility.
However, they will also be given the option to stake their $UNDEAD rewards into
the Pivot protocol, where they will earn $BTC, $ETH, $HBAR, $USDC, and $UNDEAD
yields. There will be some gamers for which the light-bulb will come on: "Huh!
I can make $BTC off my $UNDEAD? Huh!" Some of those gamers will convert to
investors into the Pivot Protocol, benefiting the protocol and the $UNDEAD
token.

Pivot Protoocol TVL growth due to the above points translates into more pivot
pools, more pivots, and larger pivots, at that. This directly benefits stakers
who, going forward, will be receiving yields more often, and yields of larger
amounts as the size of the pivots grow.
