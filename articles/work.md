# Does Pivot Arbitrage Work?



> tl;dr: yes.

-----

The benefits of Pivot Arbitrage are a two-edged sword:



1. It benefits the arbiteur in profits exceeding other investment-approaches, for: if it didn't, the arbiteur would look elsewhere to achieve financial goals.
2. It benefits the arbitraged asset.



A sword is an useful tool: otherwise, it wouldn't exist.

## Benefit to arbiteur

Proving 1. is easy: simply audit each and every pivot-trade, then compare the audited results against other investment approaches.



I have two years of audited transactions with meticulously measured results.



How am I doing?



Well, $BTC from $8k when I bought it, 2-3 years ago, is now $90k. $BTC did well.



But here's the thing: I now have more $BTC than what I would have if I had simply bought and held (an effective and efficient strategy that I have covered in other articles).



Read that again: $BTC 10x'd in the markets, but I now have MOAR $BTC.



So, I have records proving that I'm doing very, very well with pivot arbitrage.



But how are the arbitraged assets doing?



Again, that's simple to prove, and I now have the proof.


## Benefit to arbitraged asset

### Case study: $UNDEAD



$UNDEAD, this past while, has been floating around 0.14¢ (Yes. You read that price correctly), while I've been engaged away from pivot arbitrage in building infrastructure.



Yesterday, I executed 9 trades to close a $4.5k UNDEAD+USDC pivot, trade reported [here](https://x.com/pivocateur/status/1999770963324657992).



Here's my analysis.



Let's see what yesterday's UNDEAD+USDC close pivot did to $UNDEAD.

$UNDEAD performance analysis, 2025-12-13



* "δ" indicates change since 2025-12-12

* rank: 9519 (δ: 2.90% )
* quote: $0.001622 (δ: 15.86% )
* market cap: $24,111 (δ: 14.90% )
* 24-hr volume: $71,268 (δ: 8.49% )

That one close-pivot moved important metrics (including: quote, market cap, and volume) NET POSITIVE around 10% and better.



Several factors 'explain-away' the MAGNITUDE of the changes, but the ESSENCE of the change is this:



* Pivot Arbitrage positively and measurable affects arbitraged assets.
